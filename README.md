# ü§ø Sarah Lima

**`Oceanographer and GIS project developer (Diver/Swimmer)`**

As a passionate Latina oceanographer, I'm on a mission to unite Engineering and ocean preservation while exploring the Earth's mighty seas. My coding odysseys are drawn from my life as a GIS Technician in the picturesque landscapes of France. Rooted in the wisdom of my MSc in Aquaculture, Environment, and Society from the University of Crete, University of Nantes, and the University of Highlands and Islands, complemented by an MBA in Environmental Technologies from the University of Sao Paulo, my projects elegantly untangle real-life environmental and social challenges, crafted primarily in Python, with hints of R and SQL.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Sarah's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
Coding became my compass when I was still an oceanography student at the University of Sao Paulo. The mesmerizing world of C++ and MATLAB unlocked my ability to craft salinity and circulation models for ocean ecosystems. Driven by an unquenchable thirst to decode the secrets of ocean conservation, I delved into recycling strategies, conservation zones, and cutting-edge technologies. Amidst the Scottish winter, during my master's in Environmental Management, I embarked on an expedition into R and QGIS to process data from my MSc exploration of the Bay of Bourgneuf in France. In that transformative moment, I surrendered to the beguiling melody of programming. Today, I channel my experience and knowledge into enriching lives as a GIS technician and programmer, immersing myself in Machine Learning and statistics. With an unwavering resolve, I aim to ascend to greatness as an Environmental Data Scientist. My aspirations extend to the cosmos, envisaging partnerships with esteemed organizations like the European Spatial Agency and NASA, all in a noble quest to safeguard our precious oceans.
