**`Oceanographer and GIS project developer (Diver/Content Creator)`**

I'm a Latina oceanographer and content creator interested in using Engineer for ocean conservation while swimming across the seas. All coding projects are built from the ground up and focused on solving real-life problems with code. Here you will find projects I developed while a self-taught student using online resources but also projects related to GIS and social projects similar to the ones I handle on a daily basis as a GIS technician in France.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Sarah's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a curious oceanography student with a passion for learning everything I could about ocean conservation - recycling, conservation zones, and technologies. It all started with a C++ course and MATLAB where I learned to create models for ocean distribution of salinity and ocean circulation. All the while, I was teaching myself ArcGIS and QGIS with a dream of mapping the Brazilian coast, but soon I understood that the advance of programming languages and AI would change the way we work bringing enormous possibilities for ocean conservation. Now, I spend my days learning as much as I can about Machine Learning and Data Analysis with the objective of becoming the best Environmental Data Scientist I can be, and potentially working with great organizations such as the European Spatial Agency and NASA in the near future.
